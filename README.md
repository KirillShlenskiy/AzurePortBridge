# Azure Port Bridge (fork)

This is a gutted version of one of the samples from the [Azure Relay repository](https://github.com/azure/azure-relay), PortBridge.

The aim was to provide an easy-to-use command-line interface which makes it quick and easy to forward a local port via the Azure Relay service.

The work inside the PortBridge project is not my own. I've kept the tweaks to a minimum, only changing what was necessary to get PortBridge running on .NET Core.
